<h3>1. Background</h3>
<p>Around 1963, sections of forests near Mack Creek, Oregon were clear cut, meaning the trees were uniformly cut down (Gregory 2016). In 1993, Stanley V. Gregory and researchers at the Andrews Forest LTER Site began including Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in their study called <em>Aquatic Vertebrate Population Study in Mack Creek, Andrews Experimental Forest, 1987 to present.</em> The researchers recorded the weights of salamanders (g) and documented their locations within the area. The two forest sections of Mack Creek include clear cut sections as well as 500-year-old coniferous old growth forests (Gregory 2016). Within the two sections of forests, salamanders are found in Cascade, Pool and Side Channel. This report does not include salamanders found in Isolated Pool, as these areas are separated from the creek. Studying the Pacific giant salamander population in this area is relevant to understanding how new forests- the result of clear cutting- affect local wildlife populations, and how these effects compare to populations living in old growth forests.</p>

<h3>2. Data and Methods</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-and.4027.12">data set</a> used in this report was provided by the LTER Network Data Portal, and full metadata can be found <a href="https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-and.4027.12">here</a>. Sections of the forest are specified as clear cut (“CC”) and old growth (“OG”), while channel types are specified as Cascade, “C”, Pool, “P”, and Side Channel, “SC”. A Chi-squared (<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>) test was performed to determine if forest section was related to which channel type salamanders were found. Additionally, an unpaired two-sample t-test was used to find out if the weights of salamanders differed significantly between the two forest sections. Finally, a one-way ANOVA test was conducted to determine if there was a significant difference in mean salamander weight among the three channel types between the two forest sections. All analyses and figures were made using R Studio version 1.2.5001.</p>

<h4>C. Association between channel classifications and forest sections on mean salamander weights.</h4>
<p>Is there a significant difference in where in the channel Pacific giant salamanders are located (pool, cascade or side channel) between the two sections (old growth and clear cut)?</p>
<p>Looking into the Table.1, we could find that the percentages difference of two different sections within the same channel are relatively small, and all the percentages are close to 50%. It is possible that there is no connections between the sections and the channels to the weights of salamanders.</p>
<p>We use Chi-Square (<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>) test to compare proportions and find their inner relationship.</p>
<p>The Chi-Square (<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>) test results indicate that the proportions of salamanders in each section and channel type are to be expected if forest section is not a determining factor in where salamanders were located in Mack Creek. In other words, there was no significant difference in forest section (clear cut / old growth) based on which channel type salamanders were found (<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>(2) = 5.54, <em>p</em> (0.063) &gt; 0.05).</p>

<p>In year 2017, mean weight of Pacific giant salamanders (g) measured in clear cut forests (7.78 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 9.9, n = 368) was not significantly different from the average salamander weight in old growth forest areas (6.58 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 8.96, n = 328) by a unpaired two-sample t-test (t(692.79) = 1.67, <em>p</em>(0.096) &gt; 0.05) . The difference in mean weight between the two groups is 1.20 g, with a negligible effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.13). Therefore, we consider the salamander weights in clear cut areas were not significantly different from old growth ones. Histogram was presented in Figure.4.</p>

<p>We adopted the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to solve that problem.</p>
<p>This method is suitable because the data satisfies all assumptions for ANOVA:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The sample distribution should be normal. Through the beeswarm plot we could observe that most weights were concentrated at 0-6g. The data was presented as skewed to the left side. However, the sample sizes within each groups (Pool - 76, Cascade - 448, and Side channel - 164) are all more than 30, which could be considered as large enough. So the distributions of the sample statistics (mean, median) will be normally distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>Samples are independent. Due to the different locations of these three channels, the sample data collected from different places should be independent.</p></li>
<li><p>Population variances are equal. In the summary table (Table. 2), notice that the largest variance (Pool - 185.58) is less than the four times of the smallest variance (Side Channel - 68.31), which means the variances are close enough. Besides, based on the results from Levene’s Test (Levene’s F(2) = 2.39, <em>p</em> = 0.093 &gt; 0.05), there is no significant difference in variances between groups.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2017, mean weight of Pacific giant salamanders (g) measured in Cascade area (7.52 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 9.03, n = 448)，in Pool area (9.3 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 13.62, n = 76), and in Side Channel area (5.68 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 8.27, n = 164) have significant difference in at least two groups from the average salamander weight by a one-way ANOVA (F(2, 684) = 4.22, <em>p</em>(0.015) &lt; 0.05). Histogram presented in Figure.5.</p>
<p>To further study which groups differ significantly with each other, we analyzed with Tukey’s test for Honestly Significant Differences (Tukey’s HSD).
The results showed that there is no significant difference between Pool and Cascade groups (<em>p adj</em>(0.286) &gt; 0.05), and between Side Channel and Cascade groups (<em>p adj</em>(0.084) &gt; 0.05), but the mean salamander weight differed significantly between Side Channel and Pool (<em>p adj</em>(0.017) &lt; 0.05). However, the difference in mean weight between the Side Channel and Pool groups is 3.62 g, with a small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.35). Though the two groups show difference in data, it is highly possible that it happened because of accidental errors. Therefore, more research needs to be done to determine whether the two groups are actually different significantly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Limits about comparing means across the groups.</strong></p>
<p>Mean is a measurement that is easily swayed by outliers, and it looks like the data has significant outliers. It may be more beneficial to also compare medians as well to make sure that outliers aren’t affecting the accuracy of our results. This could be done through rank-based tests.</p>
