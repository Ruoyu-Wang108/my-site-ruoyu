<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Bonneville Dam, located on the Columbia River, is one of the biggest hydroelectric systems in the world (Desiree Ramirez, 2019). However, the presence of dam would block the reproducing and rearing habitats of many fishes, including salmon and steelhead (Northwest Power and Conservation Council, 2015). To alleviate the negative effects on fish, Hatchery utilities were built in 1909 and renovated in 1957 and 1998 (Oregon Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife, 2019). In this report, we will analysis and visualize time series data for adult steelhead salmon passage across the Bonneville Dam from 1939 - 2019.</p>

<p>We can see strong and consistent pattern of the monthly passage amount within one year. The annual peaks often occur in August. Summer to early fall (July to September) is the main migration season for steelhead in this area. Besides, the size of migration seemed to grow recently. Most monthly passage amounts after 2000 (lines in red color) were relatively higher than those before 2000 (lines in colors other than red), especially in peak months.</p>

<p>According to the Oregon Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife, fish protection facilities renovations were in 1957 and 1998. Because our data only includes adult fish passage, normally there would be a time lag between spawning and increasing whole population. In this annual plot, we could see a huge rise in 2001, which was three years later than the 1998 project. However, no visible improvement happened after the 1957 program.</p>

<p>From the original data, we could see strong seasonality, no clearly overall trend and cyclical trend. Considering the peak months are from July to August, we choose 3 as the window width. The trend in decomposition plot catches the changes in the original graph. The seasonal also contains the yearly peak feature. Additionally, the residuals seem relatively random.</p>

<p>We can observe strong seasonality in this data. For example, months 3-9 are positively correlated with each other. Positive correlation also happens in month 10-14. While these two group are negatively correlated.</p>
