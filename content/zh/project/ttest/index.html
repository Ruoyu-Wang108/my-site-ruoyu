<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>To limit the impact of human activities on coral reef, Marine Protected Areas (MPA) were set up (Mora, et al. 2006). In this report, two areas are located in or near the California Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas: Naples (NAPL) and Isla Vista (IVEE), where they both established as MPAs on 2012; three outside: Arroyo Quemado (AQUE), Mohawk (MOHK) and Carpinteria (CARP). The protections on reef also benefit to kelp forests (Claisse, et al. 2013). With little human interfere, MPAs help to research the effects of fishing on kelp forest community dynamics.
Spiny lobsters are part of the necessary food chains in kelp forests off southern California (Reed D. 2019). After six years of reservation, there was a 5–10% increase in the mean size of lobsters at some MPAs (Kay, et al. 2012).
Here, we use data collected by Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program to compare the population, size of lobsters in MPAs and non-MPAs from 2012 to 2018.</p>

<div id="data-and-methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Data and Methods</h3>
<p>Data for California Spiny Lobster abundance and location from 2012 - 2018 were collected and provided by <a href="https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/">Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research</a> program (SBC LTER). Samples are collected during the lobster fishing season (October to March) along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, see <a href="https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&amp;identifier=77&amp;revision=newest">metadata</a>. Lobster size distributions are faceted by site and year. Mean lobster size (mm) was compared for MPA and non-MPA areas in the same year, year 2012 and 2018 within each group by two-sample unpaired t-tests (α
= 0.05). All data analyses and figures are accomplished in R studio version 3.6.1.</p>

<p>In Arroyo Quemado area, the population of lobster has barely not changed during the years. While in Isla Vista area, the total amount of lobster has increased significantly especially in year 2016-2018, in contrast to other areas. Lobster amount in Naples generally in the trend of rising. Carpinteria’s lobster population experienced a period of increasing but dropped down in 2018.</p>

<h4>2. Lobster size distribution by time and site</h4>
<p>After the Marine Protected Areas set up in 2012, the lobster size distribution observed in 5 different areas has changed until 2018 (Figure.2).</p>

<p><strong><em>Figure. 2</em></strong> <em>Distribution of lobster size (mm) in 2012 and 2018 in five different sites. The height of bars in the figure shows the number of lobster in the size scale. The higher the bar is, the more number of lobster sizes are in that scale. The total bar area represent the total population of lobster. Data: SBC LTER.</em></p>
<p>Through vertical comparison, we can notice that in Isla Vista and Naples, the total amount of lobster has increased from 2012 to 2018; while the other three sites showed decrease in population. These site groups with different trends coincided with MPA and non-MPA group, meaning that Marine Protected Areas might have positive correlation to the population of lobster in that area.</p>
<p>Comparing horizontally, in year 2012, Carpinteria and Mohawk had relatively high population of lobster; while in year 2018, Isla Vista had the hugest amount of lobster.</p>
<p>Most lobster size concentrated in 60 - 100 mm. Mohawk used to have more bigger-size lobsters than other areas (80-120 mm). However, in 2018, little amount of big-size lobsters appeared in Mohawk. On the contrary, Isla Vista and Naples gradually have more big lobster in 2018.</p>

<h4>3. Mean lobster sizes at MPA versus non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018.</h4>
<p>To explore the possible influence of MPA policy to the lobsters size, we divided the five areas into two groups: MPA and non-MPA group, at two time point: year 2012 and 2018. We will use two-tailed, unpaired t-test to exam: is there a significant difference in lobster size mean between MPA and non-MPA groups; is there a significant difference at year 2012 and 2018 within each group.</p>
<p>Table.1 showed the summary table for lobsters in two time points and two groups. From 2012 to 2018, mean size in MPA group increased, but decreased in non-MPA group. In 2012, lobsters in MPA areas were smaller in mean than those in non-MPA group. But in 2018, MPA lobsters’ size mean exceeds non-MPA mean.</p>
