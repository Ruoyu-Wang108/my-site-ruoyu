      <h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<p>Farmer Jaden McCoy wants to identify the feasibility of expanding his goat rental business by upgrading his truck and trailer into larger ones. We estimated the revenues and costs in options, whether buying new vehicles or not over the next five years. After comparing the internal rate of return with the discount rate, we recommend McCoy to purchase new transportation but accept jobs with longer periods in exchange for higher profits in the long run.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement:</h3>
<p>Farmer McCoy is interested in expanding his goat rental business but wants to ensure that he is maximizing profits from his business. Therefore, Farmer McCoy must decide whether or not it would be more profitable to purchase a larger truck and trailer and expand to a 32-goat operation.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background:</h3>
<p>A local Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee goat farmer, Jaden McCoy, recently began renting his goats out for land clearing projects with initial success. Located in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains, Soddy-Daisy is plagued by harmful weeds, including kudzu. Goats have proven to be an efficient method for removing weeds from tough terrains, making McCoy’s goat rental business valuable. Obtaining a larger truck and trailer would allow for a larger goat operation and potentially lead to higher profits for farmer McCoy.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis:</h3>
<p><strong>a. Define goals and options</strong></p>
<p>To expand his business and capture profits in the five years, McCoy has two choices:</p>
<p><em>Option 1:</em> Not purchasing any new equipment and maintaining the current business model of renting out 25 goats at a time. This option will not capture any value from the resale of his current truck and trailer.</p>
<p><em>Option 2:</em> Purchasing a bigger truck and trailer with a 32-goat capacity. This option will capture value through the sales of both old and new transportation.</p>
<p><strong>b. Articulate key assumptions</strong></p>
<p>It is important to recognize the assumptions we made in this analysis because any change could alter our recommendation:</p>
<p>First, we assumed that there is an unlimited need for land clearing in Soddy-Daisy. So the number of available jobs won’t be a restrictive factor in farmer McCoy’s decision. While farmer McCoy’s current shepherd is only willing to work 50 five-day weeks per year and the goats must be tended by a shepherd during the jobs, the shepherd and goats can work a maximum of 250 days per year. Since 25 goats can finish one one-acre job in seven days, assuming they would keep the clearing rate, the same group of goats could complete 35 full jobs per year without the shepherd working overtime. Here we assumed that farmer McCoy would only schedule his goats to work one job per day and within each year, he would only accept jobs that would be completed. Each goat will be rented at $15 per day, regardless of whether or not they worked the entire day.</p>
<p>Second, expanding to a 32-goat operation would increase efficiency by approximately 30%. It would take a team of 32 goats about 5.5 days to complete one job. Since we assume that farmer McCoy will only perform one job each day and half-days are charged at the same rental rate for whole days, he should allot six full days for his 32 goats to finish each job. At this rate, 32 goats will be able to accomplish 41 full jobs within a year, under the same clearing rate in option 1.</p>
<p>Assumptions about additional costs include that, on average, each job will require $100 in setup costs building Trough, covered area, and mineral lick; 962 feet of fence sold at $0.75 per foot. Each workday will transport 80 round-trip miles with a cost of $0.63 per mile for the old truck, and $1.25 per mile for the new truck. Besides, we assumed that his old truck and trailer have an immediate resale value of $500 while obtaining a new truck and trailer would set him back $22,250 plus a 10% tax. The new transportation will also earn a resale value of $2,500 in the fifth year. We used an estimate of a 12% discount rate in present value calculations.</p>
<p><strong>c. Forecast revenues, costs, and operating income</strong></p>
<p>We considered McCoy’s net income, present value, and internal rate of return in budgets to compare the profitability of investing in a new truck and trailer or not. The efficiency differences between options 1 and 2 will affect the net income in each operation.  McCoy’s revenue comes from payment for his goat rental and resales his transportation. His fixed costs result from acquiring larger transportations with tax. Variable costs include shepherd wages, fence, and setup costs. After determining the net incomes (total revenue - total costs) over five years, we calculated the present value to find how much the future money is worth in today’s dollars. The net present values were then compared between options 1 and 2. Additionally, we evaluated the internal rate of return (IRR) to determine if investing in option 2 would be more profitable than not. An IRR greater than the discount rate of 12% signifies that option 2 would be the more profitable option.</p>
<p><strong>d. Financial and scenarios analyses</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, option 2 has higher profitability than option 1 in five years. In option 2,  the yearly net income was greater than option 1. Though McCoy incurs higher total costs in year 0, he would then maintain higher revenues in the following years. Additionally, when comparing option 2 to option 1, the IRR (26%) is greater than the assumed discount rate (12%). This suggests that there is greater profit potential in option 2 than 1 if McCoy’s 32-goat team could complete 41 jobs per year.</p>
<p>However, we will have different results if we did not round to the nearest whole number during the days per job and jobs per year calculations. When assuming that a 32-goat team needs, on average, 5.47 days to complete one job, we find that this team is able to complete 45.71 jobs per year. Here, the IRR is lower, at roughly 9%, making option 2 (investing in the new truck and trailer) an unfavorable decision.</p>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation:</h3>
<p>Based on our budget analysis, farmer McCoy should invest in the larger truck and trailer because it will be more profitable than his current business model under our assumptions. But McCoy should prioritize accepting jobs that require no less than six workdays to decrease costs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, McCoy could explore other possibilities to increase profitability. He could reduce the variable cost of fencing by convincing his supplier to sell him less expensive fences in bulk. McCoy could also seek the potential to work for the government. A local government contract would ensure steady employment and consistent revenue each year and thus lower the costs from advertising and setup.</p>
