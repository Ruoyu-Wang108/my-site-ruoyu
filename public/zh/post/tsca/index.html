  <div class="article-container">

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>After 40 years of waiting, the antiquated and ineffective Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) finally embraced the most sweeping overhaul in 2016. The official name of this amendment is Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, in memory of the senator who dedicated to reforming until his death (Richard Denison, 2016a). This Act passed smoothly with 403:12 in the House and unanimous voice consent in the Senate (Environmental Defense Fund, 2020; Final Vote Results for Roll Call 238, 2016). Surprisingly, this environmental bill could gain mutual support in the polarized bipartisan Congress. What happened during the process might provide valuable experience for future legislation. However, after analysis and summary of the whole process and incentives underneath, I believe that this bipartisan breakthrough was the consequence of the combination of many positive factors, in other words, “a perfect storm”. Possible affecting elements were the conversion of stakeholders, replacement of key players in the Congress, the movable position of the initial law, and the underlying bipartisan networks.</p>
<p><strong>Industries shifted their position</strong></p>
<p>As one of the most critical stakeholders, the light industry’s position somewhat determined the speed and direction of the reform wind. American Chemistry Council, the lead lobbying organization of chemical industries, was actively involved in the legislative process (Sheppard, 2015). Initially, manufacturers were content with the inefficient regulations. But, they started to feel the pressure from both international and domestic markets. On the outside, Europe launched stricter toxic substance rules in 2016. Both existing and new chemicals have to go through the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) process. As one of the main chemical product markets, the regulations directly impacted American factories (Vogel &amp; Roberts, 2011). Within home country, liberal states like California and Massachusetts had already controlled toxic chemicals through over 70 state-wide laws (Vogel &amp; Roberts, 2011). Products made in the US could no longer enter specific markets unless they followed the regulations. These demands led many manufacturers with no choice but to adopt formulas proven to be safe or obey the test requirements. Companies had to struggle with different standards. But if they refuse to adapt to regional regulations, they would lose market share. Therefore, they had to invest in several streamlines to fit in different markets. The extra costs could undermine those manufacturers’ competitive advantage compared to others only trade in the loose-controlled areas. Ultimately, industries were tired of wrangling with diverging rules. They looked forward to uniform federal standards (Eilperin &amp; Fears, 2016).</p>
<p><strong>From partisan to bipartisan reform</strong></p>
<p>Frank R. Lautenberg was a Democratic Senator from New Jersey. Lautenberg stood with his party more than 95% votes in his lifetime (Frank Lautenberg, 2013). GovTrack also evaluated him as a far-left Democratic leader (Frank Lautenberg, former Senator for New Jersey, 2013). He devoted his last career period to pursuing a safer environment with less toxic chemicals (Cory Gerlach, 2016). However, it took more than 20 years to accomplish his long-cherished will (Richard Denison, 2016b). Lautenberg’s first attempt -The Kids Safe Chemicals Act yielded in 2005- won the support from Democrats and environmental non-government organizations while strongly objected among Republicans and light industrialists without a doubt (Richard Denison, 2016b). But on the good side, this premature bill spurred attention and discussion associated with the unfavorable 1976 chemical law.</p>
<p>In 2010, Sen. Lautenberg and Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) introduced separate amendment proposals on the Toxic Substances Control Act (Environmental Protection, 2010; Richard Denison, 2016b). Both bills granted EPA more authority to supervise the toxic chemical substances. Nevertheless, lousy timing pulled these bills to nowhere: they were introduced when the Congress tried to cut EPA’s budget. Besides, it was near the midterm election, legislators, especially Republicans, did not want to waste time on these environmental measures (Vogel &amp; Roberts, 2011).</p>
<p>Instead of being frustrated by the past failure, Lautenberg turned to Sen. David Vitter (R-LA.) and developed a bipartisan bill in 2013. The partnership seemed unrealistic. David Vitter is a conservative Republican who put financial, taxation, or immigration issues above environmental protection (David Vitter, former Senator for Louisiana, 2020). Lautenberg represented environmentalists, and consumers kept pursuing safety for the household, while Vitter is the firmest ally of the chemical industry (Plautz, 2013). Opponents argued the compromised bill might defer the interests of the chemical companies rather than consumers (Sheppard, 2015).</p>
<p><strong>Key players in the Congress</strong></p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works and House Energy and Commerce Committee are the two key panels conducting and engaging environmental affairs. Back in 2013-2015, when Lautenberg and Vitter first introduced the bipartisan reformation, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) was the chairwoman of the Senate environmental panel. Disappointed with the mild overhaul, she vocally against the federal preemption clause in the first version (Eilperin &amp; Fears, 2016). Environment-passionate states, like California, had tightened their toxic chemical regulations (Anthony Adragna, 2016). The preemption of state autonomy would undermine their mature and safe monitoring system. Her position and the untimely death of Lautenberg halted the reform efforts.</p>
<p>After Sen. Lautenberg passed away, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) carried on with his work on the bill and continued to polish it (Kimberly Dean, 2015). At the same time, Republicans regained the majority position in the Senate in 2015, 114th Congress. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) replaced Boxer as the chairman in the Environmental and Public Works Committee. Republicans started to seek support for this bill, even from Democrats. For example, Inhofe endorsed the “Climate change is real and not a hoax” proposal from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), though Inhofe personally does not believe in man-made global warming (Dina Cappiello, 2015). In exchange, the environmental panel, including Whitehouse and two other liberal Democratic senators, voted in favor of the legislation. The bill was able to continue to the next step (Anthony Adragna, 2016).</p>
<p>More and more Democratic senators joined the team with the bill. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who was the ally of Boxer, now became the 59th and 60th cosponsor (Udall, Markey, Durbin Announce Agreement on Chemical Safety Reform Bill, 2015). Under the dual stress, Boxer agreed to vote for the act, but she would constantly negotiate and amend it afterward. Boxer’s back-off brought more feasibility to the measure. Her attitude change was crucial because many Republicans might give up this bill if it would take more time to argue and consider. Without bipartisan support, the toxic substances amendments would end up nowhere as Lautenberg’s past acts (Anthony Adragna, 2016).</p>
<p>On the other side, Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) stepped up as the top Democrat on the House environmental panel during the 114th Congress. Pallone and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) determined to build the reform bill with a narrower scope but still consider the most sensitive needs. In this way, they could avoid long-lasting debates and conflicts and reach an agreement quickly (Anthony Adragna, 2016). At last, the House passed the narrower reform plan by a 398-1 vote (Environmental Defense Fund, 2020).</p>
<p>After months’ concessions and reconciliation, the bicameral negotiation fruited as a new law. Though the bill offered no one everything they wanted, the compromise version already made substantial improvement over the status quo (i.e., TSCA 1976) (Richard Denison, 2016a).</p>
<p><strong>Ideology spectrum assumptions for the bill</strong></p>
<p>According to Representative John Shimkus (R-Ill), most of the proposals died during the compromise and never found a happy medium for both of the Parties. The Lautenberg Act was just a rare and lucky one (Anthony Adragna, 2016). Therefore, we could assume that the TSCA was notably on the right. Because industries desired a nation-wide regulation with more certainty, the outdated law no longer fitted in their interests. Republicans, allies of the chemical industry, moved their stances to the left side of TSCA. While Democrats always stood on the left side, opposed the inadequate and weak Act, and sought liberal amendments.</p>
<p>If we put the reform bills at the orange dashed lines, we might acquire situations that could satisfy both Democrats and Republicans. Hence, we could calculate the compromised area that reform could finalize eventually. Any other areas would receive strongly objective and blow off the whole bill. But the exact position of the final version would depend on the majority in the Congress and influence of other stakeholders. As far as Republicans and chemistry companies, they would like to nudge this bill a little from the status quo but not hurt their core benefits. The Lautenberg Amendment is most likely in the area between the Republican and the status quo. For minority Democrats and environmental groups, though not exactly happy, any improvements to the left were appreciated and valued. At least they made the first step.</p>

<p><strong>Motivations to collaboration</strong></p>
<p>To understand the pattern of the cosponsor, we need to understand their motivations. Lawmakers typically have three roles: legislation, oversight, and representation (Akirav, 2017). According to Schlesinger’s ambition theory, progressive legislators aim to win the re-election and obtain office from the party or committees. They are rational in deciding what political behaviors work best for them (Akirav, 2017). When it comes to cosponsor, they might evaluate whether this cooperation could fulfill their re-election ambitions or other career goals. For instance, lawmakers tend to adapt their decisions to public opinions and appeal to broader constituencies. Besides, following their party can build up reputations and earn trust from the party leaders. In this case, if they saw their votes’ great attention on the public health issues, or their party leader already announced their endorsement, these legislators were more likely to take part in the cosponsor program.</p>
<p>Rippere’s study separated the House and the Senate. The different systems result in differential performance and rationale for their members (Rippere, 2016). The term of each Representative is only two years. Their main goal is to win the re-election in a short time. Relatively, there is no time or incentive for them to connect with people with different party affiliations. Therefore, Representatives usually follow their party instead of communicating across the aisle.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Senators have six years to know only 100 members. Bipartisan collaboration is necessary and inevitable under many senate situations. For example, Senators can only realize their goals by preventing filibuster with two-third votes or obtaining unanimous consent. As a result, most senators have established cosponsor networks with equal numbers of colleagues from both parties (Rippere, 2016).</p>
<p>In this particular case, Rippere found that two key supporters, Vitter and Inhofe, and eight cosponsors were all Gingrich senators. They are Republicans who used to work with Newt Gingrich then move up to the Senate. Gingrich senators brought the polarized partisanship from the House to the Senate (Ezra Klein, 2015). Even the most stubborn and conservative Republicans engaged in cosponsor, meaning that it is necessary and common for Senators to work together.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Though TSCA Reform provided a perfect example of how the wonderful bipartisan cooperation could accomplish, the reform may not be the guaranteed success model for future legislation (Anthony Adragna, 2016). Many aspects play roles in promoting or preventing bills into law. Key factors include the interests of pivotal stakeholders, the current political landscape, the status quo position versus the Gridlock interval, and legislators’ preference of cooperation. Exploring bipartisan collaboration requires tremendous time, effort, and patience. As the Sen. Tom Udall said, “When people see what’s happened, they’ll say-like others have - that this is pretty close to a miracle in this environment.” Let’s hail the special and hard-won bipartisan achievement on environmental issues.</p>
