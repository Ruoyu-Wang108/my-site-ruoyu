The official name of this amendment is Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, in memory of the senator who dedicated to reforming until his death (Richard Denison, 2016a). This Act passed smoothly with 403:12 in the House and unanimous voice consent in the Senate (Environmental Defense Fund, 2020; Final Vote Results for Roll Call 238, 2016). Surprisingly, this environmental bill could gain mutual support in the polarized bipartisan Congress. What happened during the process might provide valuable experience for future legislation. However, after analysis and summary of the whole process and incentives underneath, I believe that this bipartisan breakthrough was the consequence of the combination of many positive factors, in other words, “a perfect storm”. Possible affecting elements were the conversion of stakeholders, replacement of key players in the Congress, the movable position of the initial law, and the underlying bipartisan networks.\nIndustries shifted their position\nAs one of the most critical stakeholders, the light industry’s position somewhat determined the speed and direction of the reform wind. American Chemistry Council, the lead lobbying organization of chemical industries, was actively involved in the legislative process (Sheppard, 2015). Initially, manufacturers were content with the inefficient regulations. But, they started to feel the pressure from both international and domestic markets. On the outside, Europe launched stricter toxic substance rules in 2016. Both existing and new chemicals have to go through the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) process. As one of the main chemical product markets, the regulations directly impacted American factories (Vogel \u0026amp; Roberts, 2011). Within home country, liberal states like California and Massachusetts had already controlled toxic chemicals through over 70 state-wide laws (Vogel \u0026amp; Roberts, 2011). Products made in the US could no longer enter specific markets unless they followed the regulations. These demands led many manufacturers with no choice but to adopt formulas proven to be safe or obey the test requirements. Companies had to struggle with different standards. But if they refuse to adapt to regional regulations, they would lose market share. Therefore, they had to invest in several streamlines to fit in different markets. The extra costs could undermine those manufacturers’ competitive advantage compared to others only trade in the loose-controlled areas. Ultimately, industries were tired of wrangling with diverging rules. They looked forward to uniform federal standards (Eilperin \u0026amp; Fears, 2016).\nFrom partisan to bipartisan reform\nFrank R. Lautenberg was a Democratic Senator from New Jersey. Lautenberg stood with his party more than 95% votes in his lifetime (Frank Lautenberg, 2013). GovTrack also evaluated him as a far-left Democratic leader (Frank Lautenberg, former Senator for New Jersey, 2013). He devoted his last career period to pursuing a safer environment with less toxic chemicals (Cory Gerlach, 2016). However, it took more than 20 years to accomplish his long-cherished will (Richard Denison, 2016b). Lautenberg’s first attempt -The Kids Safe Chemicals Act yielded in 2005- won the support from Democrats and environmental non-government organizations while strongly objected among Republicans and light industrialists without a doubt (Richard Denison, 2016b). But on the good side, this premature bill spurred attention and discussion associated with the unfavorable 1976 chemical law.\nIn 2010, Sen. Lautenberg and Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) introduced separate amendment proposals on the Toxic Substances Control Act (Environmental Protection, 2010; Richard Denison, 2016b). Both bills granted EPA more authority to supervise the toxic chemical substances. Nevertheless, lousy timing pulled these bills to nowhere: they were introduced when the Congress tried to cut EPA’s budget. Besides, it was near the midterm election, legislators, especially Republicans, did not want to waste time on these environmental measures (Vogel \u0026amp; Roberts, 2011).\nInstead of being frustrated by the past failure, Lautenberg turned to Sen. David Vitter (R-LA.) and developed a bipartisan bill in 2013. The partnership seemed unrealistic. David Vitter is a conservative Republican who put financial, taxation, or immigration issues above environmental protection (David Vitter, former Senator for Louisiana, 2020). Lautenberg represented environmentalists, and consumers kept pursuing safety for the household, while Vitter is the firmest ally of the chemical industry (Plautz, 2013). Opponents argued the compromised bill might defer the interests of the chemical companies rather than consumers (Sheppard, 2015).\nKey players in the Congress\nThe Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works and House Energy and Commerce Committee are the two key panels conducting and engaging environmental affairs. Back in 2013-2015, when Lautenberg and Vitter first introduced the bipartisan reformation, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) was the chairwoman of the Senate environmental panel. Disappointed with the mild overhaul, she vocally against the federal preemption clause in the first version (Eilperin \u0026amp; Fears, 2016). Environment-passionate states, like California, had tightened their toxic chemical regulations (Anthony Adragna, 2016). The preemption of state autonomy would undermine their mature and safe monitoring system. Her position and the untimely death of Lautenberg halted the reform efforts.\nAfter Sen. Lautenberg passed away, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) carried on with his work on the bill and continued to polish it (Kimberly Dean, 2015). At the same time, Republicans regained the majority position in the Senate in 2015, 114th Congress. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) replaced Boxer as the chairman in the Environmental and Public Works Committee. Republicans started to seek support for this bill, even from Democrats. For example, Inhofe endorsed the “Climate change is real and not a hoax” proposal from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), though Inhofe personally does not believe in man-made global warming (Dina Cappiello, 2015). In exchange, the environmental panel, including Whitehouse and two other liberal Democratic senators, voted in favor of the legislation. The bill was able to continue to the next step (Anthony Adragna, 2016).\nMore and more Democratic senators joined the team with the bill. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who was the ally of Boxer, now became the 59th and 60th cosponsor (Udall, Markey, Durbin Announce Agreement on Chemical Safety Reform Bill, 2015). Under the dual stress, Boxer agreed to vote for the act, but she would constantly negotiate and amend it afterward. Boxer’s back-off brought more feasibility to the measure. Her attitude change was crucial because many Republicans might give up this bill if it would take more time to argue and consider. Without bipartisan support, the toxic substances amendments would end up nowhere as Lautenberg’s past acts (Anthony Adragna, 2016).\nOn the other side, Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) stepped up as the top Democrat on the House environmental panel during the 114th Congress. Pallone and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) determined to build the reform bill with a narrower scope but still consider the most sensitive needs. In this way, they could avoid long-lasting debates and conflicts and reach an agreement quickly (Anthony Adragna, 2016). At last, the House passed the narrower reform plan by a 398-1 vote (Environmental Defense Fund, 2020).\nAfter months’ concessions and reconciliation, the bicameral negotiation fruited as a new law. Though the bill offered no one everything they wanted, the compromise version already made substantial improvement over the status quo (i.e., TSCA 1976) (Richard Denison, 2016a).\nIdeology spectrum assumptions for the bill\nAccording to Representative John Shimkus (R-Ill), most of the proposals died during the compromise and never found a happy medium for both of the Parties. The Lautenberg Act was just a rare and lucky one (Anthony Adragna, 2016). Therefore, we could assume that the TSCA was notably on the right. Because industries desired a nation-wide regulation with more certainty, the outdated law no longer fitted in their interests. Republicans, allies of the chemical industry, moved their stances to the left side of TSCA. While Democrats always stood on the left side, opposed the inadequate and weak Act, and sought liberal amendments.\nIf we put the reform bills at the orange dashed lines, we might acquire situations that could satisfy both Democrats and Republicans. Hence, we could calculate the compromised area that reform could finalize eventually. Any other areas would receive strongly objective and blow off the whole bill. But the exact position of the final version would depend on the majority in the Congress and influence of other stakeholders. As far as Republicans and chemistry companies, they would like to nudge this bill a little from the status quo but not hurt their core benefits. The Lautenberg Amendment is most likely in the area between the Republican and the status quo. For minority Democrats and environmental groups, though not exactly happy, any improvements to the left were appreciated and valued. At least they made the first step.\n   Possible political spectrum in the Lautenberg Act case   Motivations to collaboration\nTo understand the pattern of the cosponsor, we need to understand their motivations. Lawmakers typically have three roles: legislation, oversight, and representation (Akirav, 2017). According to Schlesinger’s ambition theory, progressive legislators aim to win the re-election and obtain office from the party or committees. They are rational in deciding what political behaviors work best for them (Akirav, 2017). When it comes to cosponsor, they might evaluate whether this cooperation could fulfill their re-election ambitions or other career goals. For instance, lawmakers tend to adapt their decisions to public opinions and appeal to broader constituencies. Besides, following their party can build up reputations and earn trust from the party leaders. In this case, if they saw their votes’ great attention on the public health issues, or their party leader already announced their endorsement, these legislators were more likely to take part in the cosponsor program.\nRippere’s study separated the House and the Senate. The different systems result in differential performance and rationale for their members (Rippere, 2016). The term of each Representative is only two years. Their main goal is to win the re-election in a short time. Relatively, there is no time or incentive for them to connect with people with different party affiliations. Therefore, Representatives usually follow their party instead of communicating across the aisle.\nOn the contrary, Senators have six years to know only 100 members. Bipartisan collaboration is necessary and inevitable under many senate situations. For example, Senators can only realize their goals by preventing filibuster with two-third votes or obtaining unanimous consent. As a result, most senators have established cosponsor networks with equal numbers of colleagues from both parties (Rippere, 2016).\nIn this particular case, Rippere found that two key supporters, Vitter and Inhofe, and eight cosponsors were all Gingrich senators. They are Republicans who used to work with Newt Gingrich then move up to the Senate. Gingrich senators brought the polarized partisanship from the House to the Senate (Ezra Klein, 2015). Even the most stubborn and conservative Republicans engaged in cosponsor, meaning that it is necessary and common for Senators to work together.\nConclusion\nThough TSCA Reform provided a perfect example of how the wonderful bipartisan cooperation could accomplish, the reform may not be the guaranteed success model for future legislation (Anthony Adragna, 2016). Many aspects play roles in promoting or preventing bills into law. Key factors include the interests of pivotal stakeholders, the current political landscape, the status quo position versus the Gridlock interval, and legislators’ preference of cooperation. Exploring bipartisan collaboration requires tremendous time, effort, and patience. As the Sen. Tom Udall said, “When people see what’s happened, they’ll say-like others have - that this is pretty close to a miracle in this environment.” Let’s hail the special and hard-won bipartisan achievement on environmental issues.\nReferences:\n  Akirav, O.

Introduction Bonneville Dam, located on the Columbia River, is one of the biggest hydroelectric systems in the world (Desiree Ramirez, 2019). However, the presence of dam would block the reproducing and rearing habitats of many fishes, including salmon and steelhead (Northwest Power and Conservation Council, 2015). To alleviate the negative effects on fish, Hatchery utilities were built in 1909 and renovated in 1957 and 1998 (Oregon Department of Fish \u0026amp; Wildlife, 2019). In this report, we will analysis and visualize time series data for adult steelhead salmon passage across the Bonneville Dam from 1939 - 2019.\nFigure. 1 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Steelhead) at the Oregon Zoo Picture by User: Cacophony, published on Wikimedia Commons.\n 2.

The annual peaks often occur in August. Summer to early fall (July to September) is the main migration season for steelhead in this area. Besides, the size of migration seemed to grow recently. Most monthly passage amounts after 2000 (lines in red color) were relatively higher than those before 2000 (lines in colors other than red), especially in peak months.\n c.

Because our data only includes adult fish passage, normally there would be a time lag between spawning and increasing whole population. In this annual plot, we could see a huge rise in 2001, which was three years later than the 1998 project. However, no visible improvement happened after the 1957 program.\n d.

We estimated the revenues and costs in options, whether buying new vehicles or not over the next five years. After comparing the internal rate of return with the discount rate, we recommend McCoy to purchase new transportation but accept jobs with longer periods in exchange for higher profits in the long run.\nProblem Statement: Farmer McCoy is interested in expanding his goat rental business but wants to ensure that he is maximizing profits from his business. Therefore, Farmer McCoy must decide whether or not it would be more profitable to purchase a larger truck and trailer and expand to a 32-goat operation.\nBackground: A local Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee goat farmer, Jaden McCoy, recently began renting his goats out for land clearing projects with initial success. Located in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains, Soddy-Daisy is plagued by harmful weeds, including kudzu. Goats have proven to be an efficient method for removing weeds from tough terrains, making McCoy’s goat rental business valuable. Obtaining a larger truck and trailer would allow for a larger goat operation and potentially lead to higher profits for farmer McCoy.\nAnalysis: a. Define goals and options\nTo expand his business and capture profits in the five years, McCoy has two choices:\nOption 1: Not purchasing any new equipment and maintaining the current business model of renting out 25 goats at a time. This option will not capture any value from the resale of his current truck and trailer.\nOption 2: Purchasing a bigger truck and trailer with a 32-goat capacity. This option will capture value through the sales of both old and new transportation.\nb. Articulate key assumptions\nIt is important to recognize the assumptions we made in this analysis because any change could alter our recommendation:\nFirst, we assumed that there is an unlimited need for land clearing in Soddy-Daisy. So the number of available jobs won’t be a restrictive factor in farmer McCoy’s decision. While farmer McCoy’s current shepherd is only willing to work 50 five-day weeks per year and the goats must be tended by a shepherd during the jobs, the shepherd and goats can work a maximum of 250 days per year. Since 25 goats can finish one one-acre job in seven days, assuming they would keep the clearing rate, the same group of goats could complete 35 full jobs per year without the shepherd working overtime. Here we assumed that farmer McCoy would only schedule his goats to work one job per day and within each year, he would only accept jobs that would be completed. Each goat will be rented at $15 per day, regardless of whether or not they worked the entire day.\nSecond, expanding to a 32-goat operation would increase efficiency by approximately 30%. It would take a team of 32 goats about 5.5 days to complete one job. Since we assume that farmer McCoy will only perform one job each day and half-days are charged at the same rental rate for whole days, he should allot six full days for his 32 goats to finish each job. At this rate, 32 goats will be able to accomplish 41 full jobs within a year, under the same clearing rate in option 1.\nAssumptions about additional costs include that, on average, each job will require $100 in setup costs building Trough, covered area, and mineral lick; 962 feet of fence sold at $0.75 per foot. Each workday will transport 80 round-trip miles with a cost of $0.63 per mile for the old truck, and $1.25 per mile for the new truck. Besides, we assumed that his old truck and trailer have an immediate resale value of $500 while obtaining a new truck and trailer would set him back $22,250 plus a 10% tax. The new transportation will also earn a resale value of $2,500 in the fifth year. We used an estimate of a 12% discount rate in present value calculations.\nc. Forecast revenues, costs, and operating income\nWe considered McCoy’s net income, present value, and internal rate of return in budgets to compare the profitability of investing in a new truck and trailer or not. The efficiency differences between options 1 and 2 will affect the net income in each operation. McCoy’s revenue comes from payment for his goat rental and resales his transportation. His fixed costs result from acquiring larger transportations with tax. Variable costs include shepherd wages, fence, and setup costs. After determining the net incomes (total revenue - total costs) over five years, we calculated the present value to find how much the future money is worth in today’s dollars. The net present values were then compared between options 1 and 2. Additionally, we evaluated the internal rate of return (IRR) to determine if investing in option 2 would be more profitable than not. An IRR greater than the discount rate of 12% signifies that option 2 would be the more profitable option.\nd. Financial and scenarios analyses\nIn conclusion, option 2 has higher profitability than option 1 in five years. In option 2, the yearly net income was greater than option 1. Though McCoy incurs higher total costs in year 0, he would then maintain higher revenues in the following years. Additionally, when comparing option 2 to option 1, the IRR (26%) is greater than the assumed discount rate (12%). This suggests that there is greater profit potential in option 2 than 1 if McCoy’s 32-goat team could complete 41 jobs per year.\nHowever, we will have different results if we did not round to the nearest whole number during the days per job and jobs per year calculations. When assuming that a 32-goat team needs, on average, 5.47 days to complete one job, we find that this team is able to complete 45.71 jobs per year. Here, the IRR is lower, at roughly 9%, making option 2 (investing in the new truck and trailer) an unfavorable decision.\nRecommendation: Based on our budget analysis, farmer McCoy should invest in the larger truck and trailer because it will be more profitable than his current business model under our assumptions. But McCoy should prioritize accepting jobs that require no less than six workdays to decrease costs.\nFurthermore, McCoy could explore other possibilities to increase profitability. He could reduce the variable cost of fencing by convincing his supplier to sell him less expensive fences in bulk. McCoy could also seek the potential to work for the government. A local government contract would ensure steady employment and consistent revenue each year and thus lower the costs from advertising and setup.\n","date":1574380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1574380800,"objectID":"ce071c6202d8f7b76e3d4a70c7140833","permalink":"/zh/post/goat/","publishdate":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/post/goat/","section":"post","summary":"Summary: Farmer Jaden McCoy wants to identify the feasibility of expanding his goat rental business by upgrading his truck and trailer into larger ones.

In this report, two areas are located in or near the California Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas: Naples (NAPL) and Isla Vista (IVEE), where they both established as MPAs on 2012; three outside: Arroyo Quemado (AQUE), Mohawk (MOHK) and Carpinteria (CARP). The protections on reef also benefit to kelp forests (Claisse, et al. 2013). With little human interfere, MPAs help to research the effects of fishing on kelp forest community dynamics. Spiny lobsters are part of the necessary food chains in kelp forests off southern California (Reed D. 2019). After six years of reservation, there was a 5–10% increase in the mean size of lobsters at some MPAs (Kay, et al. 2012). Here, we use data collected by Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program to compare the population, size of lobsters in MPAs and non-MPAs from 2012 to 2018.\n Data and Methods Data for California Spiny Lobster abundance and location from 2012 - 2018 were collected and provided by Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program (SBC LTER). Samples are collected during the lobster fishing season (October to March) along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, see metadata. Lobster size distributions are faceted by site and year. Mean lobster size (mm) was compared for MPA and non-MPA areas in the same year, year 2012 and 2018 within each group by two-sample unpaired t-tests (α = 0.05). All data analyses and figures are accomplished in R studio version 3.6.1.\n Results 1.

Lobster size distribution by time and site After the Marine Protected Areas set up in 2012, the lobster size distribution observed in 5 different areas has changed until 2018 (Figure.2).\n# To compare the data only in year 2012 and 2018, use filter() and select() to simplified the new dataframe. lob_compare_site \u0026lt;- lob_tidy %\u0026gt;% filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) %\u0026gt;% select(year, site, size_mm) # Creat facets labels in advance. site_labs \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Arroyo Quemado\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Carpinteria\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Isla Vista\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Mohawk\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Naples\u0026quot;) names(site_labs) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;AQUE\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;CARP\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;IVEE\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;MOHK\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NAPL\u0026quot;) # Create 10 histograms to show the distribution of lobster sizes and organize facets by site and time. ggplot(data = lob_compare_site, aes(x = size_mm)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill = site), show.legend = FALSE) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Spiny lobster size (mm)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Number of lobster in each size group\u0026quot;)+ facet_grid(year~site, scales = \u0026quot;free\u0026quot;, labeller = labeller(site = site_labs))+ scale_fill_manual(values = cbPalette) + theme_minimal()  Figure. 2 Distribution of lobster size (mm) in 2012 and 2018 in five different sites. The height of bars in the figure shows the number of lobster in the size scale. The higher the bar is, the more number of lobster sizes are in that scale. The total bar area represent the total population of lobster. Data: SBC LTER.\nThrough vertical comparison, we can notice that in Isla Vista and Naples, the total amount of lobster has increased from 2012 to 2018; while the other three sites showed decrease in population. These site groups with different trends coincided with MPA and non-MPA group, meaning that Marine Protected Areas might have positive correlation to the population of lobster in that area.\nComparing horizontally, in year 2012, Carpinteria and Mohawk had relatively high population of lobster; while in year 2018, Isla Vista had the hugest amount of lobster.\nMost lobster size concentrated in 60 - 100 mm. Mohawk used to have more bigger-size lobsters than other areas (80-120 mm). However, in 2018, little amount of big-size lobsters appeared in Mohawk. On the contrary, Isla Vista and Naples gradually have more big lobster in 2018.\n 3. Mean lobster sizes at MPA versus non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018. To explore the possible influence of MPA policy to the lobsters size, we divided the five areas into two groups: MPA and non-MPA group, at two time point: year 2012 and 2018. We will use two-tailed, unpaired t-test to exam: is there a significant difference in lobster size mean between MPA and non-MPA groups; is there a significant difference at year 2012 and 2018 within each group.\nTable.1 showed the summary table for lobsters in two time points and two groups. From 2012 to 2018, mean size in MPA group increased, but decreased in non-MPA group. In 2012, lobsters in MPA areas were smaller in mean than those in non-MPA group. But in 2018, MPA lobsters’ size mean exceeds non-MPA mean.\n# Get the corresponding category for different sites lob_tdata \u0026lt;- lob_compare_site %\u0026gt;% mutate(category = ifelse(site %in% c(\u0026quot;NAPL\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IVEE\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;MPA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;non-MPA\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(year = as.character(year)) # For the t-test later, let R know \u0026quot;year\u0026quot; is \u0026quot;factors\u0026quot; here not just \u0026quot;numbers\u0026quot;. # Calculate the mean, median, standaed deviation and sample sizes for lobsters from the MPA group and non-MPA group. lob_tsummary \u0026lt;- lob_tdata %\u0026gt;% group_by(category, year) %\u0026gt;% summarize( mean = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), median = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), n = n() ) Table. 1 Summary table of descriptive statistics for lobster size (mm) in year 2012 and 2018 separately in MPA and non-MPA site groups.

The price premium will eventually cover the costs of organic and recycled certification and new product design.\nProblem Statement To better fit in the highly intensive competitive market, follow the sustainability trends, and enhance Dove’s reputation in corporate social responsibility, I recommend Dove to introduce a new eco-friendly product series in body care and baby care. Commodities will adopt organic oat milk as one of the main ingredients with recycled paper packaging in milk carton shape. Customers may be willing to pay more for innovative and environmental friendly goods. Still, it will require time and money to earn necessary certificates and modify normal boxes into shower-friendly containers.\nBackground As part of Unilever, Dove, a personal care brand, established in 1957 only with a beauty bar (\u0026ldquo;Dove\u0026rdquo;). Now Dove expands as an international brand, owning factories in 21 countries, with products sold to over 80 countries (Bhasin \u0026amp; Nesselrode 2018). Dove’s marketing channels are diverse: retail stores, discount stores, supermarkets, and online (Bhasin \u0026amp; Dexter 2019).\nIn 2004, Dove initiated Real Beauty campaigns involving building confidence and self-esteem for women, which went viral at that time (\u0026ldquo;Dove\u0026rdquo;). Target customers of Dove are middle or middle-upper-class people. Most of them are women between 15-50 years old who care about their appearance and would like to spend money on healthier products with less harmful chemicals (Bhasin \u0026amp; Nesselrode 2018).\nCustomers today have a high tendency for sustainable and organic products. According to the statistics report from SimilarWeb, 85.05% of people get to dove.com by searching with the leading keyword “Organic” in 2019 (\u0026ldquo;dove.com Traffic Statistics\u0026rdquo; 2019).\nIn response to Unilever’s pledge on less plastic, Dove plans to use zero plastic on beauty bars globally before 2020, switch all plastic packaging into 100% recycled ones before 2025, and have created a new technology to reduce plastic in deodorant (\u0026ldquo;Dove moves to 100% recycled plastic bottles\u0026rdquo; 2019). Dove also obtained the accreditation from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), presenting their products are cruelty-free without any experiment on animals (\u0026ldquo;Dove Goes Cruelty-Free\u0026rdquo; 2018).\nL’Oréal, one of Unilever’s competitors, started a sustainable personal care brand Seed Phytonutrients in 2017. The brand featured in botanical ingredients and paper-based packaging (L’Oréal Group). Compared to similar brands, Seed captured a considerable price premium. For example, an 8.5 fluid ounce shampoo can be sold at $24 in Seed, but at $7.99 in L’Oreal Paris on their websites.\nAnalysis a.Market segment:\ni.Vegans; ii. Green advocates; iii. Parents who carefully choose products for their children; iv. Young people who like to try novel and well-designed products.\nb. Willingness to pay\nMost customers of Dove are not price-sensitive, meaning that they would pay for the price premium in exchange for organic and eco-friendly products. Dove fans, recognizing Dove’s impact on changing social perception, may support the new campaign about the environment as well.\nSome Vegan people who enjoy the oat milk may also be interested in these products. Plus, the cruelty-free products can show their value and concept as nature protectors. Environmental enthusiasts may find paper packaging performing better in creating less plastic waste than recycled plastic bottles. The organic food level experience will bring another winning point. Combining with baby care products, oat milk offers parents an impression of moisture and mild nourishment. The organic certificate seems healthier and more trustworthy than Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson who are often under suspicion with hormone issues in their baby products (CBS News 2012). The unique food-like design of the products will also catch people’s eyes on them immediately. They may imagine when applying the products, their bodies will feel like drinking oat milk too.\nc. Cost\nDove needs certifications from non-government organizations to convince consumers that its green products are guaranteed. One of the famous NGOs, The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), is most familiar and trusted by Customers. To secure the FSC recycled label, Dove must verify all wood in the products come from 100% reused material (\u0026ldquo;FSC Labels\u0026rdquo;). In the production process, every section is under a strict custody chain from certificate Conformity Assessments Bodies (CABs) (\u0026ldquo;Assurance Services International\u0026rdquo;).\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) certificates organic body care products as the same rigid regulation as organic food. Products with less than 70% organic ingredients cannot use the term “organic” (\u0026ldquo;Cosmetics\u0026rdquo; 2008). Dove also has to pay less than $750 to USDA for the organic certification cost-share program (\u0026ldquo;Organic Certification Cost Share Programs\u0026rdquo;).\nBesides, it is not sufficient to take the milk cartons as body care packaging — the new generation of pack demands robust and anti-water technologies and designs.\nTo sum up, huge costs will lie in organic raw materials, schemes for recycled containers, and all honest, responsible production resulting from these certifications.\nRecommendation Dove can also approach popular brands for organic oat milk like Oatly. The cooperation between two different areas will draw much attention and increase profits. When customers choose a body wash, they may discover the organic product associated with their familiar food brands. Other consumers might fall in love with the smell after trying the wash and become potential customers for oak milk.\nReference:   “Dove.” Unilever USA, https://www.unileverusa.com/brands/personal-care/dove.html.\n  Bhasin, Hitesh, and Graham Nesselrode. “Marketing Strategy of Dove - Dove Marketing Strategy.” Marketing91, 16 June 2018, https://www.marketing91.com/marketing-strategy-of-dove/.\n  Bhasin, Hitesh, and Dexter. “Marketing Mix of Dove - Dove Marketing Mix and 4 Ps.” Marketing91, 20 May 2019, https://www.marketing91.com/marketing-mix-dove/.\n  “Dove.com Traffic Statistics.” SimilarWeb, 2019, https://www.similarweb.com/website/dove.com#search.\n  “Dove Moves to 100% Recycled Plastic Bottles.” Unilever Global Company Website, Oct. 2019, https://www.unilever.com/news/news-and-features/Feature-article/2019/dove-moves-to-100-per-cent-recycled-plastic-bottles.html.\n  “Dove Goes Cruelty-Free.” PETA, 9 Oct. 2018, https://www.peta.org/about-peta/victories/dove-goes-cruelty-free/.\n  L’Oréal Group. “Seed Phytonutrients - L'Oréal Group: World Leader in Beauty: Official Website.” L'Oréal - L'Oréal Group, https://www.loreal.com/brand/professional-products-division/seed-phytonutrients.\n  CBS News. “Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson to Phase out Potentially Harmful Chemicals by 2015.” CBS News, CBS Interactive, 15 Aug. 2012, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/johnson-johnson-to-phase-out-potentially-harmful-chemicals-by-2015/.\n  “FSC Labels: Forest Stewardship Council.” FSC Labels | Forest Stewardship Council, https://fsc.org/en/page/fsc-labels.\n  “Assurance Services International.” ASI, http://www.asi-assurance.org/s/find-a-cab.\n  “Organic Certification Cost Share Programs.” Organic Certification Cost Share Programs | Agricultural Marketing Service, https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/occsp.\n  Cosmetics, Body Care Products, and Personal Care Product.

In 1993, Stanley V. Gregory and researchers at the Andrews Forest LTER Site began including Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in their study called Aquatic Vertebrate Population Study in Mack Creek, Andrews Experimental Forest, 1987 to present. The researchers recorded the weights of salamanders (g) and documented their locations within the area. The two forest sections of Mack Creek include clear cut sections as well as 500-year-old coniferous old growth forests (Gregory 2016). Within the two sections of forests, salamanders are found in Cascade, Pool and Side Channel. This report does not include salamanders found in Isolated Pool, as these areas are separated from the creek. Studying the Pacific giant salamander population in this area is relevant to understanding how new forests- the result of clear cutting- affect local wildlife populations, and how these effects compare to populations living in old growth forests.\nFigure. 1 Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus). Credit: Jeffrey Marsten. Wikipedia.\n Data and Methods The data set used in this report was provided by the LTER Network Data Portal, and full metadata can be found here. Sections of the forest are specified as clear cut (“CC”) and old growth (“OG”), while channel types are specified as Cascade, “C”, Pool, “P”, and Side Channel, “SC”. A Chi-squared (\\(\\chi\\)2) test was performed to determine if forest section was related to which channel type salamanders were found. Additionally, an unpaired two-sample t-test was used to find out if the weights of salamanders differed significantly between the two forest sections. Finally, a one-way ANOVA test was conducted to determine if there was a significant difference in mean salamander weight among the three channel types between the two forest sections. All analyses and figures were made using R Studio version 1.2.5001.\nFigure. 2 Map of Oregon. The location of Mack Creek is designated by the red icon. Courtesy of Google Maps.\n Results A. Annual salamander population in two forest sections of Mack Creek. Counts in clear cut forests tended to be less than counts in old growth forests until 2012.\nFigure. 3 Annual counts of salamanders in Mack Creek from 1993 to 2017. Clear cut forests were shown as orange dotted line, the old growth forests were presented as blue line with triangles. Data: Andrews Forest LTER Site.\n B. Salamander abundance by channel classification and forest sections in 2017. Table. 1 Summary table of 2017 salamander population by channel classifications (Pool, Cascade and Side Channel) in old growth (OG) and clear cut (CC) sections of Mack Creek. Data: Andrews Forest LTER Site.\n  Salamander counts by channel and sections classification in 2017     Section  Cascade  Pool  Side Channel      Clear Cut  247 (55%)  31 (41%)  90 (55%)    Old Growth  201 (45%)  45 (59%)  74 (45%)     The percentages show the proportions of salamanders in each channel type by section. For example, of the salamanders found in the cascade channel type, 55% were located in clear cut sections, while 45% were located in old growth sections.\n C. Association between channel classifications and forest sections on mean salamander weights. Is there a significant difference in where in the channel Pacific giant salamanders are located (pool, cascade or side channel) between the two sections (old growth and clear cut)?\nLooking into the Table.1, we could find that the percentages difference of two different sections within the same channel are relatively small, and all the percentages are close to 50%. It is possible that there is no connections between the sections and the channels to the weights of salamanders.\nWe use Chi-Square (\\(\\chi\\)2) test to compare proportions and find their inner relationship.\nThe Chi-Square (\\(\\chi\\)2) test results indicate that the proportions of salamanders in each section and channel type are to be expected if forest section is not a determining factor in where salamanders were located in Mack Creek. In other words, there was no significant difference in forest section (clear cut / old growth) based on which channel type salamanders were found (\\(\\chi\\)2(2) = 5.54, p (0.063) \u0026gt; 0.05).\n D. The influence of forest sections on Pacific giant salamander weights. Figure. 4 Counts of salamanders by weight for old growth and clear cut forest sections in 2017. The orange dotted line indicates mean salamander weight for clear cut sections, while the blue dotted line indicates mean salamander weight for old growth sections. The means appear relatively close together. Data: Andrews Forest LTER Site.\nIn year 2017, mean weight of Pacific giant salamanders (g) measured in clear cut forests (7.78 \\(\\pm\\) 9.9, n = 368) was not significantly different from the average salamander weight in old growth forest areas (6.58 \\(\\pm\\) 8.96, n = 328) by a unpaired two-sample t-test (t(692.79) = 1.67, p(0.096) \u0026gt; 0.05) . The difference in mean weight between the two groups is 1.20 g, with a negligible effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.13). Therefore, we consider the salamander weights in clear cut areas were not significantly different from old growth ones. Histogram was presented in Figure.4.\n E. The influence of channel classifications on Pacific giant salamanders weights. 1. Visually compare Pacific giant salamander weights between the three channel classifications.\nFigure. 5 The weight distribution, mean, and standard deviation graph of Pacific giant salamanders in channels- Pool(blue), Side Channel(pink), Cascade(green) in year 2017. Different colored points represent distribution of the samples’ weights. The grey points show the mean weights within each channel group (Side channel - 5.68, Pool - 9.3, and Cascade - 7.52), the error bars indicate the standard deviation of the data (Side channel - 8.27, Pool - 13.62, and Cascade - 9.03). Data: Andrews Forest LTER Site.\n2. Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed in Pool vs. Cascade vs. Side Channel in 2017?\nTable. 2 The summary table for different channel classifications of mean weights in Pacific giant salamanders. Data: Andrews Forest LTER Site.   Summary table of weights (g) in channels     Channel  Mean  Standard Deviation  Standard Error  Variance  Sample Size      Cascade  7.52  9.03  0.43  81.50  448    Pool  9.30  13.62  1.56  185.58  76    Side Channel  5.68  8.27  0.65  68.31  164     We adopted the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to solve that problem.\nThis method is suitable because the data satisfies all assumptions for ANOVA:\nThe sample distribution should be normal. Through the beeswarm plot we could observe that most weights were concentrated at 0-6g. The data was presented as skewed to the left side. However, the sample sizes within each groups (Pool - 76, Cascade - 448, and Side channel - 164) are all more than 30, which could be considered as large enough. So the distributions of the sample statistics (mean, median) will be normally distributed.\n Samples are independent. Due to the different locations of these three channels, the sample data collected from different places should be independent.\n Population variances are equal. In the summary table (Table. 2), notice that the largest variance (Pool - 185.58) is less than the four times of the smallest variance (Side Channel - 68.31), which means the variances are close enough. Besides, based on the results from Levene’s Test (Levene’s F(2) = 2.39, p = 0.093 \u0026gt; 0.05), there is no significant difference in variances between groups.\n  In 2017, mean weight of Pacific giant salamanders (g) measured in Cascade area (7.52 \\(\\pm\\) 9.03, n = 448)，in Pool area (9.3 \\(\\pm\\) 13.62, n = 76), and in Side Channel area (5.68 \\(\\pm\\) 8.27, n = 164) have significant difference in at least two groups from the average salamander weight by a one-way ANOVA (F(2, 684) = 4.22, p(0.015) \u0026lt; 0.05). Histogram presented in Figure.5.\nTo further study which groups differ significantly with each other, we analyzed with Tukey’s test for Honestly Significant Differences (Tukey’s HSD). The results showed that there is no significant difference between Pool and Cascade groups (p adj(0.286) \u0026gt; 0.05), and between Side Channel and Cascade groups (p adj(0.084) \u0026gt; 0.05), but the mean salamander weight differed significantly between Side Channel and Pool (p adj(0.017) \u0026lt; 0.05). However, the difference in mean weight between the Side Channel and Pool groups is 3.62 g, with a small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.35). Though the two groups show difference in data, it is highly possible that it happened because of accidental errors. Therefore, more research needs to be done to determine whether the two groups are actually different significantly.\n3. Limits about comparing means across the groups.\nMean is a measurement that is easily swayed by outliers, and it looks like the data has significant outliers. It may be more beneficial to also compare medians as well to make sure that outliers aren’t affecting the accuracy of our results. This could be done through rank-based tests.\n  Summary  Channel locations and sampling forest sections are independent (Table. 1). The mean weight of salamanders in old growth and clear cut sections of the forest were not significantly different in 2017 (Figure. 4). Within the three channels, the mean salamander weight differed significantly between Side Channel and Pool, but not with other groups (Figure. 5).   References Gregory S. V. 2016.
